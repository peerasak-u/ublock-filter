# Thai Content uBlock Origin Filter Lists

This repository contains custom uBlock Origin filter lists specifically targeting annoyances on Thai movie, manga, anime, and series websites.

## Filter Lists

The filters are split into categories:

*   `movie.txt`: Filters for movie-related sites.
*   `manga.txt`: Filters for manga-related sites.
*   `anime.txt`: Filters for anime-related sites.
*   `series.txt`: Filters for series-related sites.

## How to Subscribe

To use these filters, subscribe to the main manifest file in uBlock Origin:

1.  Go to uBlock Origin Dashboard > Filter lists > Custom.
2.  Check "Import".
3.  Paste the following URL (once hosted, e.g., on GitHub):
    ```
    [YOUR_RAW_MANIFEST_URL_HERE]
    ```
    *(Replace `[YOUR_RAW_MANIFEST_URL_HERE]` with the actual raw URL after uploading to a host like GitHub)*
4.  Click "Apply changes".

The manifest file (`ublock-th-filters.txt`) automatically includes all the category lists.
